# API_Testing
This Git repo consist 2 API Testing Projects, one without data and the other one with data. 

1. TestingAPIPostman is a API Testing Project. I got the Free APIs from https://simple-books-api.glitch.me to Postman and then done complete testing and validation check using Authorization, Test, Body Pre-request script on CreateToken(Post), StatusofBooks(GET), ListOfBooks(GET), GetaSingleBook(GET), SubmitanOrder(POST), GetAllOrder(GET), GetAnOrder(GET), UpdateAnOrder(PATCH), DeleteOrder(DELETE) actions.

2. In BooksAPI_DataDriven, I have done testing and validation check using Authorization, Test, Body Pre-request script on SubmitanOrder, GetAnOrder, DeleteOrder actions but this time used Data Driven Testing so that i can validate the API response against the big data.
